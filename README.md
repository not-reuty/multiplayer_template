The goal of this project is to create a server and client capable of communicating with one another through the internet in the Godot game engine.
On top of this, a very basic implementation of client side prediction for each players position, specifically `prediction`, `reconciliation`, and `interpolation` [described here](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/client-side-prediction-live-demo.html) on any connected clients.
